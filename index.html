<p>Here are the 2 basic ways of hacking the website and making it either to LAG or to Crash. Anything that would happen bad or terrible to yourself because you knew how to do this hacking stuff and did this to a very sensitive network of the government will not be my fault. Please use this hacking wisely and you will be safe.</p>

<a id="command-prompt" class="anchor" href="#command-prompt" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Command Prompt</h1>

<p>To Begin Try knowing how to use command promt first before doing more complicated stuff because If you dont have the brains to do this you might get arrested.
So First of All, Open the Command Prompt with Administrative Privileges. Then You wanna type ping then the website you want to target.  ping (website) then wait for the command to finish and remember the IP address of your website.
After That you wanna go and type again ping and this time the IP address with -t then after that -l then set it from 0-65500.
So It should look like this ping (IP ADDRESS) -t -l 65500. Then You will know see that youre command prompt is sending bytes to the server of the website. Now if you leave if for a while you might notice that the website is getting laggy. If you are lucky you might be able to crash it.</p>

<a id="hoic" class="anchor" href="#hoic" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>H.O.I.C</h1>

<p>Now you might be wondering "What's and H.O.I.C.?" Well that stands for High Orbit Ion Cannon. This is basically the much more safer version of the Low Orbit Ion Cannon (L.O.I.C). So to begin with it you need to open the H.O.I.C. After you have opened it you wanna go and click the "+" below the "Targets" and type in the site you wanna target. For Ex. <a href="https://lol.blogspot.com">Fluffy</a> .
After you are done adding the target you wanna go and consider changing your booster before clicking add. So just click the empty box and scroll down and look for GenericBoost. Then Click Add.
Then You will need to change the number of threads. So Beside the TARGET section on the left of it you will See Threads. Change the number of that to about 5+.Why? Because if you set it to like 4 and below the website might be able to catch up.
Now Click on FIRE TEH LAZER! and wait for a specific amount of MB has been released. Then try going to the website without turning off the program.
Now you Will see that the Website has crashed and will not be accesible until you stop the FIRE TEH LAZER!</p>
